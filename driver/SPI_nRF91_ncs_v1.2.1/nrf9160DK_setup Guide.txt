Use SPI flash on the DK to nRF9160. 

By default, the SPI flash routed to on Board nRF52840, requires to map the Flash to 9160 before any testing. 

NCS v1.7.0 (tested version)

Got to /zephyr/samples/hello_world

Create a overlay file "nrf9160dk_nrf52840.overlay"

Then add the follow lines to it. 

	&external_flash_pins_routing {
		status = "okay";
	};

Then build the project with  command :  west build -b nrf9160dk_nrf52840@0.14.0

Flash to nRF52840 (hello world will output to the serial driver id 0002). 

Then switch back to debugging with nRF9160. 

Please Power circle the board before next step. 

Now SPI should talking to the SPI flash.
